# 📊 Data-Driven Digital Collections Strategy for Fintech Loan Provider

## Overview

This project provides a data-driven approach to optimize digital collections for a fintech loan provider. It focuses on reducing non-performing loans (NPLs), streamlining collections processes, and improving customer engagement through actionable insights and automation.

## Problem Statement

Fintech lenders and microfinance institutions often struggle with inefficient collections and high default rates. This project solves this challenge by applying analytics and automation to:

- Predict at-risk loans.
- Segment borrowers based on behavior.
- Automate reporting and collections workflows.
- Provide real-time decision-making dashboards.

## Objectives

- Reduce NPLs through data insights and predictive analytics.
- Improve collections performance with real-time dashboards.
- Automate manual reporting and tracking processes.
- Promote responsible collections strategies.
